                                the recommendations that appear on our site might be from companies from which we
                                receive affiliate compensation. Such compensation may impact how, where and in which
                                order offers appear on our site. Other factors such as our own proprietary algorithms
                                and first party data may also affect how and where products/offers are placed. We do not
                                include all currently available financial or credit offers in the market in our website.
